        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> If you plan on adding cheese to your eggs, make sure that the cheese is shredded/prepared and set aside so you can add it to the skillet quickly. Place your skillet on the stovetop and turn on the heat. I leave the heat somewhere between medium low and medium, so it warms up but doesn't get too hot.
        
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Meanwhile, prepare your eggs. Break them into a bowl with a tablespoon of water or milk, some salt and pepper. I use about 1/8 tsp salt and a pinch of pepper; you might use more or less according to taste. If you're dairy intolerant or don't like the taste of milk you can use water. I personally love the way milk enhances the flavor of the eggs.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Use a fork or whisk to beat the eggs briskly for 30-60 seconds, making sure the eggs are fully broken up and mixed well with the milk and the seasonings. Use a little elbow grease here, the more you whip it the better.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Lightly grease your hot skillet, coating the surface with a thin layer of oil or butter (or a combination of oil and butter). If using spray oil, use caution and keep it away from any open gas flames.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Pour the eggs into the skillet. Keep the heat on medium/medium low, you don't want to rush it here-- if the skillet is too hot the eggs will cook too quickly and become rubbery. Once you pour the eggs in they will begin to cook immediately. Using a spatula (I use a wooden or silicone spatula so I won't damage my pan's nonstick coating), begin pulling the cooked outer edges in towards the center of the eggs. Uncooked eggs will flood the area you just pulled back. If you are adding cheese, now is the time to sprinkle it into the skillet. This will allow ample time for the cheese to melt and integrate into the eggs.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Move the spatula around the edge of the skillet, pulling the cooked edges towards the center and re-flooding repeatedly. Cooked scrambled eggs will gather in the center of the skillet.</p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Preheat oven to 425Â°. Place pork tenderloin into the freezer for 15 minutes; this will make it easier to slice thinly.
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Slice frozen tenderloin as thinly as possible. Transfer to a medium bowl, add 3 tablespoons hoisin sauce, 3 tablespoons rice vinegar, garlic, and fish sauce to bowl; mix until well combined. Let sit at room temperature for 15 minutes. </p>
        <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Toss carrot and daikon with remaining vinegar and salt; let sit at room temperature until ready to use. In a large cast-iron skillet on medium high, heat oil and add marinated pork. Cook without stirring for 4 minutes. Give it a toss and continue to cook 1 minute.</p>
        <p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Toast baguette in oven for 10 minutes until golden brown. Spread mayonnaise on bottom half and remaining hoisin sauce on top half. Layer pork, then pickled veggies and cilantro on bottom half. Place on the top half and slice cross wise before serving.</p>
